# FCR Redesign + PT Reframe — Implementation Plan

**PRD:** [FCR Redesign + PT Reframe](https://www.notion.so/3684b58e32c3804b921df8e39b4bfae7)  
**Tracking:** [FCR redesign](https://www.notion.so/FCR-redesign-3764b58e32c38022a0efea1122f22d93)  
**Tag:** `#FCRRedesign`

---

## Context

This plan covers three tightly coupled changes:

1. **Remove InsOnly mode** — `TargetMode.inspirationOnly` deleted entirely
2. **Reframe PT** — from currency/compensation mechanic to pure wins journal; 1 PT required per failed cycle in FCR
3. **Redesign FCR** — new single-screen card UI with purposeful stop (failed) + celebration (passed), backfill via reused components, new `CycleRecord` persistence, streak summary

The mockup is at `documentation/FCRMockup.html`.

---

## Architecture Summary

### What's Removed

- `TargetMode.inspirationOnly` case and all associated logic
- `PositivityTokenStep` (the old step 2 of FCR)
- `PositivityTokenCompensator` and `AfterPositivityTokenReportBuilder`
- `PositivityTokenUsageSummary`
- `PositivityToken.status` / `dayOfStatus` — replaced by SwiftData relationship
- Monthly PT cap
- PT mint capacity formula (`checkIns - tokensCreated`)
- `CurrentCycleDialogModifier` and `CurrentCycleDialogContent` (used `until` to set InsOnly for current cycle)
- `WeekStartChangeHandler` InsOnly snap logic
- `CommitmentFormFields` InsOnly date picker UI
- `CommitmentFormDraft.inspirationOnlyUntilValidation`

### What's Added

- `**CycleRecord`** — new SwiftData model, append-only, written when FCR closes
- `**FCRCycleCardView**` — new expandable card per cycle in FCR
- `**InsOnlyCycleOutcome**` enum — `excused | punished | letGo | other` label on failed cycles
- **PT as wins journal** — `PositivityToken` loses `status`/`dayOfStatus`; gains `consumedByCycleRecord` relationship. "Consumed?" = `consumedByCycleRecord != nil`
- **Inline PT minting in FCR** — mint sheet inside FCR if not enough active PTs
- **Streak summary** — computed from check-in data, shown on failed cycle cards

### Reused Components (do not rebuild)

- `CommitmentHeatmapInfoCard` — history expansion inside each cycle card, toggled by 📅 icon
- `BackfillSheet` — opened from "Add check-in" in InfoCard, clamped to cycle date range
- `CheckInUndoBannerOverlay` + `CheckInUndoManager` — undo toast after backfill

---

## Design Decisions

### Remove InsOnly entirely (not just the end date)

The FCR redesign (purposeful stop + excused/let-go labels) absorbs everything InsOnly was trying to do. Keeping the mode adds complexity with no remaining benefit. See InsOnly PRD for original removal rationale.

### CycleRecord is append-only, no retroactive reconciliation

Cycle changes (weekly → monthly) may create gaps. Accepted. History reflects what was reported at the time.

### Streak summary uses check-in ground truth, not CycleRecord

`CycleRecord` labels (excused/punished) are not layered onto streak counts — cycle boundary changes make mapping unreliable. Raw check-in counts against cycle boundaries are the source of truth.

### PT: relationship is the single source of truth

`PositivityToken.status` and `dayOfStatus` are removed. The SwiftData relationship is the single source of truth for whether a PT is consumed:

- `PositivityToken.consumedByCycleRecord: CycleRecord?` — nil = free in journal, non-nil = consumed by a failed cycle
- `CycleRecord.consumedPT: PositivityToken?` — inverse relationship

**Why not keep `status` as belt-and-suspenders:** two sources of truth cause drift bugs. One relationship is sufficient.

**Cascade concern:** if `CycleRecord` is deleted, the PT is freed (nullify rule). Accepted — `CycleRecord` is append-only in practice, so this is theoretical. If we ever allow deleting `CycleRecord`s, freeing the PT is probably the right behavior anyway.

**Wins journal UI** does not display the FCR linkage — but the data is stored for future use. "Free vs consumed" is surfaced as a filter if needed later.

### CycleRecord: cascade delete from Commitment, snapshot title + counts

- `@Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)` from `Commitment` — deleting a commitment deletes all its `CycleRecord`s. No orphaned history.
- `snapshotTitle: String` — commitment title at FCR time. Survives title changes on the commitment.
- `targetCount: Int` + `checkInCount: Int` — snapshot of target and actual check-ins at FCR close time. Survives later backfills or check-in deletions.
- Full check-in history is NOT snapshotted — `CheckIn` records are the live truth for that.

### CycleRecord: fields grouped by outcome

Failed and passed cycles share the same model but fields are semantically grouped:

- **Always present:** `id`, `commitment`, `snapshotTitle`, `cycleStart`, `cycleEnd`, `targetCount`, `checkInCount`, `recordedAt`
- **Passed only (nil/empty if failed):** `emojiReactions: [String]`
- **Failed only (nil if passed):** `outcome: CycleOutcome?`, `reflectionText: String?`, `consumedPT: PositivityToken?`

### Phase order: 2B before 2A

`CycleRecord` is introduced first (2B) so the `PositivityToken` relationship can reference it when PT is simplified (2A).

## Roadmap

The work naturally splits into 5 phases. Phases 1–2 are foundational and must complete before the others. Phases 3–5 can be parallelized after Phase 2.

---

### Phase 1 — Remove InsOnly (foundation for everything)

**Goal:** Eliminate `TargetMode.inspirationOnly` from the codebase. Everything downstream either simplifies or stops compiling — that's intentional, it surfaces all call sites.

#### Commit 1A — refactor: remove InsOnly from TargetMode and all call sites `#FCRRedesign`

**Modify:** `Shared/Models/TargetMode.swift`

- Delete `inspirationOnly` case
- Add custom `Codable` `init(from:)` that maps old stored `inspirationOnly` data → `.on`
- Simplify/delete: `effectiveMode(on:)`, `effectiveMode(from:to:)`, `overlapsInspirationOnlyInterval`, `normalized`, `partialInspirationOnlyOverlap`

**Modify:** `Shared/Models/Commitment.swift`

- Remove `normalizeMode(afterReportedThrough:)` (no-op without InsOnly)

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Settings/WeekStartChangeHandler.swift`

- Remove `InspirationOnlyCommitmentInfo`, `oldUntil/newUntil/isExpiredAfterSnap`
- Simplify `previewChanges` and `apply` — no InsOnly snapping

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

- Remove `inspirationOnlyUntilLabel` helper

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/SingleCommitment/CommitmentDetailView.swift`

- Collapse InsOnly branch of `targetModeDetailText` — unreachable, delete

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/SingleCommitment/CommitmentRowView.swift`

- Collapse InsOnly branch of `targetSummaryText` — unreachable, delete

**Delete:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/CurrentCycleDialogModifier.swift`

- This entire feature only existed to set `until: cycleEnd` on InsOnly. Gone.

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/Form/AddCommitmentView.swift`

- Remove `CurrentCycleDialogModifier` usage

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/Form/EditCommitmentView.swift`

- Remove `CurrentCycleDialogModifier` usage

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/Form/CommitmentFormFields.swift`

- Remove InsOnly date picker, Forever toggle, related bindings

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/Form/CommitmentFormDraft.swift`

- Remove `inspirationOnlyUntilValidation`, simplify `canSave`, `reanchorInspirationOnlyTarget`

**Update tests:** Delete all `until`-bearing tests in `TargetModeTests`, `CommitmentFormDraftTests`, `WeekStartChangeHandlerTests`, `CommitmentSlotStatusInspirationOnlyTests`

**Manual verification:** Launch on iPhone 17 simulator. App must launch without crash. Existing InsOnly commitments must open without crash (custom decoder maps them to `.on`).

---

### Phase 2 — CycleRecord introduction + PT model simplification

**Goal:** Introduce `CycleRecord` first (2B), then simplify `PositivityToken` to reference it (2A). Schema version bump required.

#### Commit 2B — feat: add CycleRecord SwiftData model `#FCRRedesign`

**Create:** `Shared/Models/CycleRecord.swift`

```swift
enum CycleOutcome: String, Codable {
    case passed
    case excused
    case punished
    case letGo
    case other
}

@Model final class CycleRecord {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: UUID

    // Cascade — deleting a Commitment deletes all its CycleRecords
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Commitment.cycleRecords)
    var commitment: Commitment

    var snapshotTitle: String       // commitment title at FCR close time
    var cycleStart: Date
    var cycleEnd: Date
    var targetCount: Int            // target at FCR close time
    var checkInCount: Int         // check-in count at FCR close time
    var recordedAt: Date

    // Passed cycles only (empty if failed)
    var emojiReactions: [String] = []

    // Failed cycles only (nil if passed)
    var outcome: CycleOutcome?
    var reflectionText: String?
    // Nullify — freeing PT if CycleRecord is ever deleted
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .nullify, inverse: \PositivityToken.consumedByCycleRecord)
    var consumedPT: PositivityToken?
}
```

**Modify:** `Shared/Models/Commitment.swift`

- Add `@Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \CycleRecord.commitment) var cycleRecords: [CycleRecord] = []`

**Modify:** `Wilgo/WilgoApp.swift`

- Add `CycleRecord.self` to `Schema([...])`

**Update test schemas:** Add `CycleRecord.self` to all `makeContainer()` functions in test files.

**Create:** `WilgoTests/CycleRecord/CycleRecordModelTests.swift`

- `CycleRecord` persists with correct fields
- `snapshotTitle` survives after commitment title is changed
- `checkInCount` / `targetCount` are snapshots — do not change when check-ins are added/removed after FCR
- Deleting `Commitment` cascades to `CycleRecord`
- Deleting `CycleRecord` nullifies `PositivityToken.consumedByCycleRecord` (PT freed)
- `outcome` round-trips Codable

**Manual verification:** App launches, no crash, existing data intact.

#### Commit 2A — refactor: simplify PositivityToken, remove status/dayOfStatus `#FCRRedesign`

**Modify:** `Shared/Models/PositivityToken.swift`

- Remove `status: Status` enum and property
- Remove `dayOfStatus: Date?`
- Add `@Relationship(deleteRule: .nullify) var consumedByCycleRecord: CycleRecord?`
- Add custom `Codable` `init(from:)` to handle old stored tokens with `status`/`dayOfStatus` — ignore those fields on decode, set `consumedByCycleRecord = nil`
- "Consumed?" = `consumedByCycleRecord != nil`

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/PositivityToken/ListView.swift`

- Remove used/expired grouping — flat journal list, newest first
- Remove "monthly budget remaining" + capacity indicator

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/PositivityToken/PositivityTokenMinting.swift`

- Delete or gut — minting is now unrestricted

**Delete:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/PositivityTokenCompensator.swift`
**Delete:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/PositivityTokenStep.swift`
**Delete:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/PositivityTokenPage.swift`

**Update tests:** Delete `PositivityTokenMintingTests`, `PositivityTokenCompensatorTests`

---

### Phase 3 — New FCR UI (after Phase 1 + 2)

**Goal:** Replace the two-step FCR with the new single-screen card-based UI.

#### Commit 3A — feat: FCRCycleCardView stub with expand/collapse `#FCRRedesign`

**Create:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/FCRCycleCardView.swift`

Stub with:

- Collapsed state: status dot, title, date, badge, chevron
- Expanded state: card header with badge + 📅 icon + ↑ minimize icon
- 📅 icon toggles `CommitmentHeatmapInfoCard` inline (pass `onAddCheckIn` → triggers `BackfillSheet`)
- `CheckInUndoBannerOverlay` wired up for backfill undo
- Live count badge updates when check-ins change
- Auto-flip: if check-ins hit target → switch to passed state; if undo drops below target → switch back to failed state
- Failed state: streak summary line + label pills + required textbox + PT row (stub: always "needed")
- Passed state: optional emoji reaction row
- Passed cycles: start collapsed, no required fields

#### Commit 3B — feat: wire FCRCycleCardView into new FinishedCycleReportView `#FCRRedesign`

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/FinishedCycleReportView.swift`

- Replace two-step navigation with single scrollable list of `FCRCycleCardView`
- Title: "Cycle Report" (not date-based)
- Nav bar: Cancel (left) + Done (right, disabled until all failed cycles complete)
- Done button logic: all failed cycles have label + reflectionText + PT consumed
- Remove `preTokenReportForTokenStep` state
- Remove `PositivityTokenStep` navigation destination

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/CheckInSummaryStep.swift`

- Remove entirely or gut — replaced by `FCRCycleCardView`

**Delete:** old `CheckInSummaryPage.swift` (UI replaced)

#### Commit 3C — feat: streak summary computation `#FCRRedesign`

**Create:** `Wilgo/Features/Commitments/FinishedCycleReport/StreakSummary.swift`

```swift
enum StreakSummary {
    static func compute(for commitment: Commitment, currentCycleEnd: Date) -> String?
    // Priority (final — implemented as 3 cases + nil):
    // 1. "N consecutive failed cycles"      — leading failures >= 2
    // 2. "First failure after N consecutive wins"
    //                                        — single trailing failure after a
    //                                          real win run (streak >= 2), OR a
    //                                          lone first slip (streak 1, no
    //                                          earlier failures in window)
    // 3. "Failed X of the last Y cycles"    — flaky on/off: single-cycle win gap
    //                                          AND 2+ failures in the window
    // nil — single failure with no prior context
}
```

**Note (folded cases):** the original 4-case list collapsed during implementation.
"No passed cycles in X months" (old Case 4) is just a long consecutive-failure run,
already covered by Case 1. Case 3 was kept but redefined: it only fires for genuinely
flaky on/off patterns (single-win gap), so a real slip after a win run still gets the
gentle Case 2 message.

Computed from check-in data against cycle boundaries — no dependency on `CycleRecord`.
12-cycle lookback, stops at the commitment's anchor.

**Create:** `WilgoTests/FinishedCycleReport/StreakSummaryTests.swift`

- Each of the 3 cases + priority ordering
- Nil when first cycle / no context

---

### Phase 4 — PT gate in FCR + inline minting (after Phase 2 + 3)

**Goal:** Wire the PT requirement into the FCR card. Each failed cycle must consume 1 PT before Done unlocks.v

#### Commit 4A — feat: PT consumption gate in FCRCycleCardView `#FCRRedesign`

**Modify:** `FCRCycleCardView.swift`

- PT row shows "Covered" (green) if a PT is assigned, "Needed" (red) if not
- "Needed" row has "+ Mint one now" button
- Tapping opens inline mint sheet (text field + "Save & use as PT")
- On save: create new `PositivityToken`, hold reference in card's draft state
- If user already has active PTs (`consumedByCycleRecord == nil`): auto-assign oldest available

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/PositivityToken/AddView.swift`

- Keep standalone minting flow unchanged — minting from PT tab still works

#### Commit 4B — feat: write CycleRecord on FCR close `#FCRRedesign`

**Modify:** `FinishedCycleReportView.swift`

- On Done tap: for each cycle card, write a `CycleRecord` to SwiftData
- Passed cycles: `outcome = .passed`, `emojiReactions` from card state, `consumedPT = nil`
- Failed cycles: `outcome` from label, `reflectionText` from textbox, `consumedPT` set to assigned PT (sets `pt.consumedByCycleRecord` inverse automatically via SwiftData)
- Advance watermark as before

---

### Phase 5 — Cleanup + test coverage (after all phases)

#### Commit 5A — refactor: remove dead FCR code + update all tests `#FCRRedesign`

- Delete `PositivityTokenUsageSummary` from `Models.swift`
- Remove `consumedPTReasons` from `CycleReport`
- Delete `PreTokenReportBuilder` references to InsOnly `effectiveMode`
- Update `FinishedCycleReportBuilderTests`, `FinishedCycleReportPresentationStateTests`
- Update `PositivityTokenModelTests` for simplified model

#### Commit 5B — feat: PT wins journal view polish `#FCRRedesign`

**Modify:** `Wilgo/Features/PositivityToken/ListView.swift`

- Clean flat journal list, grouped by month
- Each entry: reason text + date
- No status grouping, no budget display
- Keep minting flow (+ button)

## Open Questions Before Starting

- [ ] Tracking link from 3Sauce for commit messages
- [ ] Does `PreTokenReportBuilder` need to be renamed/refactored or just updated in place?
- [ ] Should passed cycles that the user never expanded also get a `CycleRecord` written? (Lean: yes, with `outcome = .passed` and empty emoji reactions)
